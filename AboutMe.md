# Welcome to my webpage.
On this webpage you will find out about my projects, my hobbies and who I actually am.
I won't write my full official name in this webpage, because of privacy reasons.
On assumtion that those I lead to this page already know my name, I will first summarise my projects.
## My projects 

I am currently working on a collection page, because It is not running on server in this moment I am just putting here a link to Github.
The count of repos is bigger than the actual projects, because of prototypes and forks.
Most forks were created to make helpful pullrequests, so they are also part of things that I did.

## My hobbies 

- Cooking
- drawing of Mangas
- Video Games
## What games do I play?

Since the answer will change all the time, it would be better for me to just link my steam account.
I play some single player games and also multiplayer games, my favourite game is Darksouls.
