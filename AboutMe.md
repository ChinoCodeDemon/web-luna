# Welcome to my webpage.

On this webpage you will find out about my projects, my hobbies and who I actually am.
I won't write my full official name in this web page, because of privacy reasons.
On assumtion that those I lead to this page already know my name, I think it will be fine if I leave it out.


## My projects 

I am currently working on a collection page, because It is not running on server in this moment I am just putting here a link to Github.
The count of repositories is bigger than the actual projects, because of prototypes and forks.
Most forks were created to make helpful pull requests, so they are also part of things that I did.

## What games do I play?

## What are my favourite programming languages?

I started of with C and C++, but only feel home at those languages.
The programming language that I really love is **typescript** and my most often used language is **python**.

Python is a very flexible language that makes it possible to create projects very quickly with the drawback that it's one of the most unperformant languages.

Meanwhile Typescript is a very tough language, thanks to the v8 engine (Javascript) It is one of the fastest interpreter languages, the typing makes it easier for code editors to include full hints on what a variable actually contains. Since It's directly transpiled to Javascript it can be used on every machine, even those that can only browse the web.
